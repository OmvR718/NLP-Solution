      Overall QoS concept
4.7.1 PDN (Packet Data Network (internet)) connectivity service
The Evolved Packet System provides connectivity between a UE (User Equipment (mobile device)) and a PLMN external packet data network. This is
referred to as PDN Connectivity Service.

      . This is
referred to as PDN Connectivity Service. The IP PDN Connectivity Service supports the transport of traffic flow aggregate(s), consisting of one or more Service
Data Flows (SDFs). NOTE: The concept of SDF is defined in the context of PCC (Policy And Charging Control), TS 23.203 [6], and is not explicitly visible in the
NAS (Non-Access Stratum (signaling)) signalling.

The EPS bearer in general
For E-UTRAN access to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core) the PDN connectivity service is provided by an EPS bearer for GTP-based S5/S8, and
if IP is in use, by an EPS bearer concatenated with IP connectivity between Serving GW and PDN GW for PMIP-based
S5/S8.

      etween Serving GW and PDN GW for PMIP-based
S5/S8. In this release of the specifications, dedicated bearers are only supported for the IP PDN Connectivity Service. When User Plane (S1-U) is used for data traffic, then an EPS bearer uniquely identifies traffic flows that receive a
common QoS treatment between a UE and a PDN GW for GTP-based S5/S8, and between UE and Serving GW for
PMIP-based S5/S8.

      Initial Attachment LTE E-UTRAN
A UE (User Equipment (mobile device))/user needs to register with the network to receive services that require registration. This registration is described
as Network Attachment. The always-on IP connectivity for UE/users of the EPS (Evolved Packet System (LTE core)) may be enabled by establishing a
default EPS bearer during Network Attachment.
