section_47_P1|parent|section_47|ROOT|251|7a6ef738|Overall QoS concept\n4.7.1 PDN (Packet Data Network (internet)) connectivity service\nThe Evolved Packet System provides connectivity between a UE (User Equipment (mobile device)) and a PLMN external packet data network. This is\nreferred to as PDN Connectivity Service. The IP PDN Connectivity Service supports the transport of traffic flow aggregate(s), consisting of one or more Service\nData Flows (SDFs). NOTE: The concept of SDF is defined in the context of PCC (Policy And Charging Control), TS 23.203 [6], and is not explicitly visible in the\nNAS (Non-Access Stratum (signaling)) signalling. A PDN connection to an SCEF has the following characteristics:\n- It is only supported for WB-EUTRA (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access), LTE-M and NB-IoT (Internet of Things) RAT types;\n- It applies only when Control Plane CIoT EPS (Evolved Packet System (LTE core)) Optimisation are applicable;\n- It does not support the transport of traffic flow aggregate(s);\n- It does not support Emergency Services.
section_47_P2|parent|section_47|ROOT|284|4052ee15|gate(s);\n- It does not support Emergency Services. The EPS bearer\nThe EPS bearer in general\nFor E-UTRAN access to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core) the PDN connectivity service is provided by an EPS bearer for GTP-based S5/S8, and\nif IP is in use, by an EPS bearer concatenated with IP connectivity between Serving GW and PDN GW for PMIP-based\nS5/S8. In this release of the specifications, dedicated bearers are only supported for the IP PDN Connectivity Service. When User Plane (S1-U) is used for data traffic, then an EPS bearer uniquely identifies traffic flows that receive a\ncommon QoS treatment between a UE and a PDN GW for GTP-based S5/S8, and between UE and Serving GW for\nPMIP-based S5/S8. The packet filters signalled in the NAS procedures are associated with a unique packet filter\nidentifier on per-PDN connection basis. NOTE 1: The EPS Bearer Identity together with the packet filter identifier is used to reference which packet filter\nthe UE intends to modify or delete, i.e. it is used to implement the unique packet filter identifier. An EPS bearer is the level of granularity for bearer level QoS control in the EPC/E-UTRAN.
section_47_P3|parent|section_47|ROOT|295|313d3408|y for bearer level QoS control in the EPC/E-UTRAN. That is, all traffic mapped\nto the same EPS bearer receive the same bearer level packet forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue\nmanagement policy, rate shaping policy, RLC (Radio Link Control) configuration, etc.). Providing different bearer level packet forwarding\ntreatment requires separate EPS bearers. NOTE 2: In addition but independent to bearer level QoS control, the PCC framework allows an optional\nenforcement of service level QoS control on the granularity of SDFs independent of the mapping of SDFs\nto EPS bearers. One EPS bearer is established when the UE connects to a PDN, and that remains established throughout the lifetime of\nthe PDN connection to provide the UE with always-on IP connectivity to that PDN. That bearer is referred to as the\ndefault bearer. Any additional EPS bearer that is established for the same PDN connection is referred to as a dedicated\nbearer. The EPS bearer traffic flow template (TFT (Traffic Flow Template)) is the set of all packet filters associated with that EPS bearer. An UpLink\nTraffic Flow Template (UL (Up Link) TFT) is the set of uplink packet filters in a TFT.
section_47_P4|parent|section_47|ROOT|267|100c9cfd|TFT) is the set of uplink packet filters in a TFT. A DownLink Traffic Flow Template (DL\nTFT) is the set of downlink packet filters in a TFT. Every dedicated EPS bearer is associated with a TFT. A TFT may\nbe also assigned to the default EPS bearer. The UE uses the UL TFT for mapping traffic to an EPS bearer in the uplink\ndirection. The PCEF (for GTP-based S5/S8) or the BBERF (for PMIP-based S5/S8) uses the DL TFT for mapping\ntraffic to an EPS bearer in the downlink direction. The UE may use the UL TFT and DL TFT to associate EPS Bearer\nActivation or Modification procedures to an application and to traffic flow aggregates of the application. Therefore the\nPDN GW shall, in the Create Dedicated Bearer Request and the Update Bearer Request messages, provide all available\ntraffic flow description information (e.g. source and destination IP address and port numbers and the protocol\ninformation). For the UE, the evaluation precedence order of the packet filters making up the UL TFTs is signalled from the P-GW to\nthe UE as part of any appropriate TFT operations.
section_47_P5|parent|section_47|ROOT|258|0b7f1401|the UE as part of any appropriate TFT operations. NOTE 3: The evaluation precedence index of the packet filters associated with the default bearer, in relation to\nthose associated with the dedicated bearers, is up to operator configuration. It is possible to "force"\ncertain traffic onto the default bearer by setting the evaluation precedence index of the corresponding\nfilters to a value that is lower than the values used for filters associated with the dedicated bearers. A TFT of an uplink unidirectional EPS bearer is only associated with UL packet filter(s) that matches the uplink\nunidirectional traffic flow(s) A TFT of a downlink unidirectional EPS bearer is associated with DL packet filter(s) that\nmatches the unidirectional traffic flow(s) and a UL packet filter that effectively disallows any useful packet flows (see\nclause 15.3.3.4 in TS 23.060 [7] for an example of such packet filter.

The UE evaluates for a match, first the uplink packet filter amongst all TFTs that has the lowest evaluation\nprecedence index and, if no match is found, proceeds with the evaluation of uplink packet filters in increasing order of\ntheir evaluation precedence index. This procedure shall be executed until a match is found or all uplink packet filters\nhave been evaluated. If a match is found, the uplink data packet is transmitted on the EPS bearer that is associated with\nthe TFT of the matching uplink packet filter. If no match is found, the uplink data packet shall be sent via the EPS\nbearer that has not been assigned any uplink packet filter. If all EPS bearers (including the default EPS bearer for that\nPDN) have been assigned one or more uplink packet filters, the UE shall discard the uplink data packet. NOTE 4: The above algorithm implies that there is at most one EPS bearer without any uplink packet filter. Therefore, some UEs may expect that during the lifetime of a PDN connection (where only network has\nprovided TFT packet filters) at most one EPS bearer exists without any uplink packet filter.
section_47_P7|parent|section_47|ROOT|265|271ab646|PS bearer exists without any uplink packet filter. To ensure that at most one EPS bearer exists without any uplink packet filter, the PCEF (for GTP-based S5/S8) or the\nBBERF (for PMIP-based S5/S8) maintains a valid state for the TFT settings of the PDN connection as defined in\nclause 15.3.0 of TS 23.060 [7] and if necessary, adds a packet filter which effectively disallows any useful packet flows\nin uplink direction (see clause 15.3.3.4 in TS 23.060 [7] for an example of such a packet filter) to the TFT of a\ndedicated bearer. NOTE 5: The default bearer is the only bearer that may be without any uplink packet filter and thus, a packet filter\nwhich effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction will not be added by the\nPCEF/BBERF. The initial bearer level QoS parameter values of the default bearer are assigned by the network, based on subscription\ndata (in E-UTRAN the MME (Mobility Management Entity (core network)) sets those initial values based on subscription data retrieved from HSS (Home Subscriber Server (user database))).
